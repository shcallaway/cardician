## Adding CLI Shortcut

You should create a bash alias for Cardician. This will make it easy to invoke the application from any directory on your machine. 

Add the following line to your `.bashrc` file (or your `.bash_profile`):

```alias card=ruby\ /Users/<your username>/Desktop/Cardician/cardician.rb```

Remember to replace the username placeholder with the corresponding value. This line creates the alias `card` for executing the main file. If your Cardician directory is somewhere other than Desktop, modify the directory accordingly.
